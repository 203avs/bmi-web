📘 About Body Mass Index (BMI)
Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple and widely used screening tool that helps assess whether an individual has a healthy body weight relative to their height. It is calculated using the following formula:

BMI
=
Weight (kg)
Height (m)
2
BMI= 
Height (m) 
2
 
Weight (kg)
​
 
The result is a number that places individuals into categories such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.

🧮 BMI Categories:
Underweight: BMI less than 18.5

Normal weight: BMI between 18.5 and 24.9

Overweight: BMI between 25 and 29.9

Obese: BMI 30 and above

✅ Why BMI Matters
BMI is a quick, non-invasive method to assess body fat levels and potential health risks. Maintaining a healthy BMI is associated with lower risks of chronic diseases like:

Heart disease

Type 2 diabetes

High blood pressure

Certain cancers

It also encourages awareness around lifestyle choices related to diet, physical activity, and general well-being.

⚠️ Limitations of BMI
While useful as a general guideline, BMI has several limitations:

Muscle Mass: It cannot differentiate between weight from muscle vs. fat. A muscular person may be classified as overweight or obese.

Gender Differences: Women typically have more body fat than men, which isn’t reflected in the BMI score.

Age: Older adults may lose muscle mass and gain fat without changing BMI significantly.

Ethnicity: BMI risk thresholds may vary slightly among different populations.

💡 Conclusion
BMI is a valuable first step for identifying potential weight-related health risks, but it should not be used in isolation. For a complete picture of health, it should be combined with other assessments such as body composition, waist circumference, and overall lifestyle evaluation.
